# RateME

### Description

A mobile app that allows users to rate other users of the app anonymously. 

### How it works
A user creates an account, giving some information about themself (adding photos if they want). After that he may search for people that he personally knows and friend them. After he has created a connection with that person he can rate him (from 1 to 5), choosing a category for each rating (physique, looks, how they dress, how they speak, are they funny, etc). 

You can only be rated by someone you befriended on the app. you can choose to rate that person, change that rating over time, or not rate at all. The user can see his rating and the number of other users that rated him, but he cannot see who rated him or what rating he got from that person.
